# EEPROM I2C Driver – TM4C129X

## Overview
This project implements a basic EEPROM driver using the I2C interface on a TM4C129X ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.

## Features (Planned)
- I2C-based EEPROM read and write
- Data persistence across power cycles
- Page-safe write handling
- Bit-level data optimization
- Data integrity using checksum

## Hardware
- MCU: TM4C129X
- Interface: I2C
- EEPROM: External I2C EEPROM

## Status
Project setup completed. Driver implementation in progress.
